## Briefs for each stage

### ðŸ”´ Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### ðŸŸ¡ Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### ðŸŸ¢ Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### ðŸ”µ Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### ðŸŸ£ Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

*When i thought about time i thought of old film reels showing a galloping horse in motion, and as well as seeing the passage of time through destruction and degradation so i decided to combine the two. i kind of went for a 'crazy doomsday timer' aesthetic, and allowed the viewer to 'begin time' through their own interaction with the program. I used a combination of fund images from google for the horses, and photos of photos in a magazine i found on my computer of a collapsing building, and then set up a seconds counter for the doomsday vibe. i was aiming for the feeling of running through time lightheartedly despite the decay of the world as time passes on. *

*Hearing Interactivity, I'm reminded of all the images and information shown to me throughout my day.  A lot of the information I don't want to see, but it is hard not to be forced to see images and ads everywhere.  I thought of the OVERACTIVITY of all the images on random.  We are overloaded with ideas, images, and information every few seconds in life.*

*Right away I knew that I wanted to carry on and build on the idea of over interactivity and show the amount of content we are exposed to everyday, through social media and the internet in general. The checkbox represents the act of clicking online, so once itâ€™s clicked everything pops up onto the screen. I loved the randomness of the different mixes of images so I kept them and changed their opacity so they blended together as a background. I used a few different APIs to draw data from, drew them to the canvas, overlapping to create a confusing list of words and numbers. I also made a CSV file with some random data to create two line graphs adding to the show of data on the screen.
I kept the horse images and the minute counter, to continue the underlying theme of time passing, and to represent how much time can be lost while scrolling or surfing the internet.
I wanted to get across how overwhelming it can feel being online in this day and age. And how we are often bombarded with information, ads and content that we don't necessarily want to see or are interested in.*

#### Overview:
- I really liked the aesthetic of Emma's take on Time Jockey - i think the three collages that were cycling through the code are really interesting and feature some cool images. I decded to play on these images and created a game that centres around the original images of the horse which was featured in Kike's code. I really wanted to keep this galloping horse still a major character in the game. Overall there are 16 different locations that are all connected by different paths that the user has some autonmy over choosing. Each location has two options to chooose from roughly. The locations get more and more abstract as the user continues thorugh the game. Although it was really time-consuming it was super fun to make and I had a lot of fun using the ranodmness aspect from the previous codes from Emma, Christina and Kike.

#### Attributes:
- I created each of the locations by inputing prompts into an AI image generator which I have found to be really successful over the course for creating interesting imagery. I wrote down around 20 potential locations and then made some prompts for each location to see when the generator could come up with. Some worked better than others and took some trial and error.
- I created a simple base for the game that allowed me to layout all the text and pathways, then I went back in and linked everything together with a storyline I kind of created just on the fly as I went through.
- I wanted to use the same font as what is used in basic code (i found out this is monospace), I tried a retro video game font but it looked too contrived.

#### Problems/challenges:
- this whole thing was seriously tedious as each time I changed the text the whole webpage would reload back to the starting slide. I had to go through the whole game each time in order to check the spelling and even changing a single letter would throw me back to square one again.
- I had some inital trouble with loading all the images - the pathways were a bit weird at times and also the aspct ratios of the images were really ugly. I decided to just let them be crispy and stretched to hopefully add to the budget feel of the work lol.
- I needed some help from ChatGPT to get the horse to gallop in a loop next to the text, but I think an element of animation adds a lot to the game.
- theres probably some typos in the text lol. it was so hard to format the text in code, especially splitting up each line manually by having to add a backwards slash + 'n' every. single. few. words.

*I loved the many scenic pathways Odette used in her game but the one that called to me most was the deep sea tunnel. Therefore I chose to create an abstract simulation of a deep sea environment. I created 3 classes for this: Fish, Seaweed and Krill. The purple ellipses are supposed to represent a school of fish while the thin green rectangles are strands of seaweed and the smaller moving particles behind them are krill/plankton. I opted for a sea-green background that is redrawn with a 50% opacity when the objects are drawn so that you can see some light traces of their paths as you would if they were moving through water. My choice in colours is primarily cool tones because that is what I picture when I think of the deep sea. There is a large black circle in the centre that represents a black hole sea tunnel at the bottom of the ocean combining 2 different elements from Odette's backgrounds, the black hole and the sea tunnel.*
